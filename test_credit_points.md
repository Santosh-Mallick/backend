### Credit Point Calculation
- **1 Credit Point = 100 Eco-friendly pieces**
- Each pack contains 50 pieces
- Points are calculated as: `Math.floor(totalPieces / 100)`

### Examples:

#### Example 1: 1 Pack of Organic Disposal Plates
- Quantity: 1 pack
- Pieces: 1 Ã— 50 = 50 pieces
- Points earned: Math.floor(50 / 100) = **0 points**

#### Example 2: 2 Packs of Organic Disposal Plates
- Quantity: 2 packs
- Pieces: 2 Ã— 50 = 100 pieces
- Points earned: Math.floor(100 / 100) = **1 point**

#### Example 3: 3 Packs of Organic Disposal Plates
- Quantity: 3 packs
- Pieces: 3 Ã— 50 = 150 pieces
- Points earned: Math.floor(150 / 100) = **1 point**

#### Example 4: 4 Packs of Organic Disposal Plates
- Quantity: 4 packs
- Pieces: 4 Ã— 50 = 200 pieces
- Points earned: Math.floor(200 / 100) = **2 points**
